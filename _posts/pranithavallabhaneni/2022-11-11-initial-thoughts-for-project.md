Till now I have worked on turtle in all of my previous exercises but for the end result of programming, I'm planning to do the **Data Analysis** 
type of project.

**Introduction about my project :**

Since I came from a medical background and willing to specialize in *Health Informatics*, Python has become an increasingly popular tool in the 
healthcare industry for its ability to handle large data sets quickly and easily. Python is being used to develop application, algorithms
and data analysis that provide early detection of disease, improve patient outcomes and make healthcare more cost effective.


I want to work on something that will help me in my future specialization in Health Informatics so I have choosen
**Analyzing Healthcare data** as my final project.

Looking forward to working on it.
