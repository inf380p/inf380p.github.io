**Project Introduction:**

Being a student from the healthcare background I would like to utilize my skills learnt in this class to be used to analyze 'Health Nutrition and Population Statistics' data set that is available in the CSV format.


**Milestones:**
- [x] Find datasets that are aligned with the scope of the project. 
- [x] Think of how the data needs to be represented to the user.
- [x] Create a sketch of the program flow.
- [x] Start coding to show the avaialble options and take in user input.
- [ ] Find necessary libraries that help to represent data to the user.
- [ ] Read the csv data as per user selection.
- [ ] Use the library functions to represent data based on user selection.
- [ ] Expand the scope of the project to other dataset categories.
- [ ] Test the program flow.


**Progress:**

Since last class
- It took sometime to gather some datasets related to 'Health Nutrition and Population Statistics' of the past few years from different countries and regions that would be of best help for my project.
- I later drafted a rough sketch on how the user interacts with the program to view the statistics of the data sets that are available in the program. Here is my rough draft of the interface.

- So far I have just accomplished writing only a small amount of code which takes in user input and have written a funtion that reads data from the csv files. Here is the sample Trinket.

**Next steps:**
- With the above interface in my mind I would like to move forward in identifying various libraries like Pandas, Pyplots etc which would be used to show the data in a proper representational formats that are easily understandable by the user.
- Make some progress on the code to read the respective csv files based on the user selections and then pass the data to the python functions represent the data from the dataset.

**Reflection:**

1. Are there any roadblocks ahead? Is there anything your group can do to help out?

   So far I haven't found any roadblocks. But in the journey to the final project I may find difficulties and suggestions from peers would be of great help.
  
2. Are your milestones ambitious enough? Make sure to include some stretch goals.
   
   My goals, expectations and outcome of this project are pretty ambitious so far since I'm from a non engineering background.
   This project also includes alot of ambiquity which I'm trying to unwind one step at a time.
   
 3. Are your milestones too ambitious? Make sure to break down the unglamorous parts of coding into chunks that reflect the actual work to be done.
    
    I feel like my milestones are not way too ambitious for now based on my findings and the progress I am making to accomplish the desired output.
 
 4. Are you able to keep to your plan? Looking back at what youâ€™ve actually done, is the difference accountable to bad planning (i.e. not anticipating what needed to be done), bad execution (not doing it), or something else?
 
    Initially I have very vague idea on what to implement and how to structure the project. But spending sometime and dividing things into small tasks and trying to solve them helped me to make progress. I initially had no clear plan on how to implement the project due to which I had to spend a lot of time figuring out things to make some progress. This taught me the importance of planning, drafting tasks and milestones. With dividing a functionality into small tasks and working on accomplishing these tasks helped me make progress quickly and I plan to follow this approach further.
