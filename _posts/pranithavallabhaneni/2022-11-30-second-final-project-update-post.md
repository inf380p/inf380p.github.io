**Milestones:**

- [x] Find datasets that are aligned with the scope of the project. 
- [x] Think of how the data needs to be represented to the user.
- [x] Create a sketch of the program flow.
- [x] Start coding to show the avaialble options and take in user input.
- [x] Read the csv data as per user selection
- [x] Find and explore necessary libraries that help to represent data to the user.
- [x] Pick one library functionality and implement it on one dataset.
- [ ] Expand the scope of visual data representation of csv data with various library functions
- [ ] Implement all the various visual data representations for other data sets based on user selection
- [ ] Test the program flow.

**Previous Update**

- Finalized on the datasets.
- Sketched the interface and flow.
- Started coding with few interactive options for the user to choose. 
 
 **Current Progress**

Made a lot of progress since the past update. As a continuation to my initial update of my final project I have imported libraries like  *pandas* and *matplotlib* and started exploring them with various examples. To explore those functions it took me alot of time to understand initially and then after several trail and errors, I understand the functionality and started implementing them. I started with one data set and implemented the matplot function with a fixed column. I'm now tring to implement the functionality of matplot based on user selected columns only.

Here is the snapshot of the progress. <br> <iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python3/3e6555cd79" width="100%" height="356" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


 **Next steps**

- Expand the matplot library to various datasets.
- Implement pie charts and bar diagrams for the suitable datasets.
- Make the program represent the data based on user selection of datasets and columns.
