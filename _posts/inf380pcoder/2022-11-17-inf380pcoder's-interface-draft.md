I decided to change my idea from the last class. After thinking about it more, I decided that my first idea was probably too ambitious for this project. There were some elements that I’m not sure I’d be able to figure out. So I decided to switch gears. Instead, I thought of doing a minesweeper game, where the user tries to click various buttons and attempts to avoid hitting a bomb. I’m not sure if I’ll be able to get it to work, but I think it will be a more attainable project for me compared to my previous idea.

So far I have created a rough design of the game. It doesn’t have any working click features yet, but my plan for next week is to work on creating the features for when a user clicks on each square, so it will display either a number or a bomb. After that, I need to add in a score feature, win screens, then the other levels. So far this is what I have crossed off my list. Once I’m able to complete the above steps, I should make more progress in checking off my to-do list: 

- [ ]  At least one external data file<br />
- [ ]  Dictionaries<br />
- [ ]  Custom modules<br />
- [ ]  Definite `(for)` loops<br />
- [X]  Custom functions<br />
- [ ]  Have a graphical interface, responding to click events<br />
- [X]  Consistently available help dialog (kind of..)<br />
- [X]  Display information about programs state<br />
- [ ]  Have at least 3 levels<br />
- [ ]  Extend a custom turtle class<br />
- [ ]  Have a ‘win’ screen<br />
- [ ]  Have an iterative interface<br />
- [X]  Use on or more custom images<br />

**Are there any roadblocks ahead? Is there anything your group can do to help out?**

I think there are going to be several roadblocks for me. I’m not quite sure how I’m going to execute some of the assignment requirements, such as inputing dictionaries into the game. I’m still trying to think through creating the multiple levels and the win screen. I created a startup screen for the program, but I’m thinking that instead I should have had the startup screen be an option for the different levels, with `level 1`, `level 2` `level 3`, a `help` option, and an `exit` option. Then the game would go into what I have right now.



**Are your milestones ambitious enough? Make sure to include some stretch goals.**

I think my milestones are ambitious enough. I’m hoping that I can complete the main functionality of the game in the next week, then work on the other levels. I didn’t come in to this class with any previous experience, so even creating a basic game is progress for me. 



**Are your milestones too ambitious? Make sure to break down the unglamorous parts of coding into chunks that reflect the actual work to be done.**

They may be a little overly ambitious. I’m still not sure if I’ll be able to complete all of the features that I want for this game in the timeframe, but I’m going to try! 


**Are you able to keep to your plan?**

I think I’ll be able to stick to the initial timeline that I posted in my last reflection. Next week, I should have more time to sit down and work on the actual functioning of the game. Then I can continue to work on the other levels during week three, and then work on troubleshooting problems in the final week. 

- Week 1: Review the turtle materials, create a rough design of the game, and map out design for each level :white_check_mark:
- Week 2: Create a rough iteration of the game, such as the menu, click functions, and score features
- Week 3: Continue to expand on the game, such as the extra levels, and fix any bugs; continue to note major  steps taken and problems encountered to be included in the final reflection
- Week 4: Work on debugging the program, adding any final elements, and complete the final reflection on the process<br />

**Here is my trinket showing what I have so far:**
