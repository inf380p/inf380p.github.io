<h1>Final Project Idea</h1>

**What excites you?**

Something that I find enjoyable with coding is the element of creativity. It allows the coder to to create applications like drawing functions or games which can incorporate user input. I enjoyed the class assignment where we tried to build turtle programs and I could see them evolve as I went. 

**What info will help you decide?**

Initially, I was debating between the two final project options. I’m interested in archives, which was initially the reason that I took this class. I think a data processing project would be useful for my future career trajectory. However, the main factor that I’m considering is which type of program I could conceivably complete successfully in the allotted time. I had a lot of trouble on the data processing assignment, so that leads me to lean more in the direction of a turtle program. However, in the future I’d like to spend more time revising the data processing assignment, and improve my familiarity with that area of coding. 

**What project will you pick?** :turtle:

I think ultimately, I’m going to choose a turtle project for the final assignment. 

**Initial ideas:** :joystick:

I’m not quite sure what type of game that I will do for the final project, but I was inspired by some of the older retro games that I played as a kid. I was thinking something along the lines of block breaker type of game, which could incorporate user input to hit different colored blocks, which would each have a different point value. It could start out slow with one ball then add in more, which could increase in speed. At the end of the three levels, there would be a display of the number of blocks that were hit and the total score. 

As a coding newbie, I want to pick something that’s attainable for me within the timeframe. If this idea turns out to be too simple, I was thinking I could add in additional bonus items to hit for extra points, or another element to add complexity. 

**Work plan:** :video_game:

Week 1: Review the turtle materials and create the design of the game with the included features

Week 2: Create a rough iteration of the game, such as the setup, the background, movement, and score features

Week 3: Continue to expand on the game, such as the extra levels, and fix any bugs; make note of all of the steps taken to be included in the final reflection 

Week 4: Work on debugging the program, adding any final elements, and complete the final reflection on the process
