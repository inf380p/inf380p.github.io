title: "My Initial Project Ideas"

For my project I will definitely be working on a Turtle Program. Thinking about what excites me, I keep going towards problem solving games. In my own time I really like to play wordle, sudoku and random card games that use strategy. Maybe I will explore how I can bring that in. 
I will need to do a lot of my own clarification for this project on the concepts, along with looking for inspiration. I might seek out tutorials so that I can drill in the concepts and process, but also gain some insights on fun creative possibilities.
