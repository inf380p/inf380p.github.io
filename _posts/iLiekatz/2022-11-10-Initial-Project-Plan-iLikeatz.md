### Project Working On 
I am 100% doing a turtle program. I have a lot of struggles with getting comfortable with code. I have had time to do supplemental work with turtle stuff, so I feel more comfortable working with it than a data processing program.

### What Excites Me?
Thinking about what excites me, I keep going towards problem solving games. In my own time I really like to play wordle, sudoku and random card games that use strategy. Maybe I will explore how I can bring that in. 

### What do I need to help decide?
I will need to do a lot of clarification for this project, along with looking for inspiration. I might seek out tutorials so that I can drill in the concepts and process, but also gain some insights on fun creative possibilities.

### Milestones
**First** I need to do some brainstorming and gain a clear picture of what I want to do. To accomplish this I will explore turtle games on the internet. This will be purely exploratory and not copying like Elliot mentioned! I will also continue some of my tutorial work that has been helping me get better at code, and I will hopefully find inspiration within that.
I am not sure what my next milestones will be because I am in such beginning stages of what is possible for this that I canâ€™t really wrap my head around specific milestones.
