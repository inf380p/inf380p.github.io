# First focused reflection 
## Difficult Runestone problems1
First runestone problem is that I’m stocked with making full screen size to show the entire birthday balloon. 

## Correct and revised code

```
my_turtle_screen.setup(800, 800)

```

## Difficult Runestone problems2
Second runestone problem is about user input to calculate and invite a number of friends. I wanted to ask more detailed questions such as age, name, availability to invite the party and confirm participation. After reading chapters and learning a dictionary, I can be able to add more questions to complete the invitation.

# Clicky Turtlehack

## Difficult Runestone problems1
For the clicky turtlehack, the hardest part of clicky's assignment is to control the turtle’s position and one other aspect of its state. Because I wanted to make the key like a pencil to write a message with interactive heart!!So now, I realized that I can control and draw like pencil when I use screen.onclick(drawline),(drawcircle),(drawsquare) and (drawstar).

# CSV Reflection

## Difficult Runestone problems1
I was wondering that how I re-select which colums get printed. But I couldn't find way to expect which columns need to print. After class, I saw haley's experiment so that I can figure that out the `while True:` loop, the column choice can now be executed multiple times until the entire program is exited.

This was easy after defining `get_columns_to_print()`! All I had to do was call it under `3: Select columns to print`:

```
  elif choice_str == "3":

    get_columns_to_print()

```
