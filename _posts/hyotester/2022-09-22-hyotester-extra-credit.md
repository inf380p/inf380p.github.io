# First focused reflection 
## Difficult Runestone problems1
First runestone problem is that Iâ€™m stocked with making full screen size to show the entire birthday balloon. 
## Correct and revised code


```
my_turtle_screen.setup(800, 800)

```

## Difficult Runestone problems2
Second runestone problem is about user input to calculate and invite a number of friends. I wanted to ask more detailed questions such as age, name, availability to invite the party and confirm participation. After reading chapters and learning a dictionary, I can be able to add more questions to complete the invitation.
