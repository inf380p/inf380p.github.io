#Project Description
My initial idea for the final project came from a insight that I discovered my current capstone working with AI IN HEALTH LAB. 
When an emergency patient or a patient's family visits the hospital for the first time, they are hard time to find ICU due to the complicated hospital structure. Delays in admission and finding the right location from the ED are associated with increased IP LOS and IP cost. 
Improving patient flow/experience through the ED can reduce hospital costs and improve the quality of care. 
Therefore, my final project I mainly use Turtle's turtle.pos() method to build a map "FIND YOUR LOCATION IN HOSPITAL." 

# Initial milestones?
-Drawing or import hospital map (images) at the right scale
-Write code and Calculate the speed and direction to search for current place / follow right direction / arrive final destination

# Initial work plan?

- Import screen / hospital map 
- Find my coordinates (the turtle's current location) and explore the distance from the turtle to arrive the final destination
