## How did it go?
I attended “Intro to Data Science 2 Week Free Course” hosted by Bill C on November 7. To begin with, I've been working as a data scientist in AI HEALTH LAB for almost a year. My background was UX design so that I’m always fit to analyze complicated dataset in healthcare. 

So, it was a precious learning experience during 2 weeks! The course purpose of the meetup was to explore practical skills and concepts of Python, Statistics, and Data Science and then create simple projects from the learning experience. 

## What did you learn?
I learned to set up python libraries such as 'pandas' and a data analytics module that runs on top of NumPy.

* Python Foundation and how to install python libraries 
*How to quickly visualize data using Numpy
*How to work on data cleaning such as missing values
*Time series forcasting

## Would you find value in this kind of event after class?
Definitly, networking gives me a chance to meet professionals in the data industries and learn about real world experience that will help me to prepare projects. 

## How was the experience different from your expectations?
I used to join the meetup when I started and got into the UX field. It was good to remind me of my past good memories that I struggled with a career in a new field ,but was passionate to learn through the event. I was expected to learn basic python, but I learned more challenging skills such as Time series forcasting. 

## Could you see yourself becoming a member of a professional community like this in the future?

For sure, I really want to work on the project with young and inexperienced students like myself to achieve their dream jobs!
