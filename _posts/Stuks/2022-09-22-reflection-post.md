# Reflective Text

I've been struggling with this class and the programing. I've never been good with math and numbers and a lot of the phrases and codes remind me of past experiences dealing with arithmetic. In class excises go well but the second I try to do any coding at home, I get overwhelmed and need to take a break. I honestly feel like I'm drowning a bit, even though it all makes sense when its shown to me in class. I also get a lot of anxiety looking around and noticing so many others are doing so much better than I am. It's never good to compare yourself to others but with all the sharing this class employees its really not to feel inadequate. 

That said, I did actually have a really fun time working on the custom turtle project. I was able to get my tina to change color, change the background color and then was able to make her change shape. But what really got me excited was when I was able to allow the user to input what shape they would want Tina to draw. I did a bit of research on other commands and was able to get the basics down using the drawing commands from our first homework. After that though I expanded and added a Circle for Tina to draw, which I was honestly surprised it worked the way it did. And finally, I tried to code in for Tina to draw a star and somewhere along the line I messed up, but to actually good success because she actually drew a hexagon instead! I wasn't expecting that and it really made my day. I'm curious how many times in programing people just sort of luck into situations like that that work out even better than they anticipated.

While I do feel overwhelmed and lost, the experience of getting my little turtle to do all the commands I wanted was really exciting. I guess I'm at the bottom right now with no where to go but up? Hopefully.


## Interactive Code
Here is the code that was my lightbulb moment.

## Static Block:
I'm trying the static block here
```
def hexagon():
  for i in range(6):
        tina.forward(90)
        tina.right(60)
```
