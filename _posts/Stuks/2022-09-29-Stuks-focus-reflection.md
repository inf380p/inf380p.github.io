I'm posting my focused reflection, will have to edit it a bit later.

This class has been pretty challening and I'm really not entirely too sure how I'm going to go about completeing it. When I do the coding in the homework readings and look at the stuff we do in class, I can kind of get it. At least like looking at the codes on their own I can get it. But there is something struggling with me when it comes to kind of using the code with other pieces of the code? It's weird I'm not how to describe it.

In addition to the text book I've been trying to us w3schools to help with my practicing. They offer some onsite training right next to the example which I find useful. I want to try and focus on getting to make my turtle make shapes and different colors but have more options. I've hand put in the shapes right now but I think its a bit limited. I also couldn't get the color option to work, I wanted to be able to let them fill in a different color.
