title: "Mufaddal's Initial Project Idea"
---

For my final project, I will be working towards creating a game. Ever since I got into this class, my aim was to learn programming to create games. My aim with this project is not to take a complicated concept or involved storyline for a game, but create a simple game but do it well, and with polish.

One of the first games that fascinated me due to its simplicity was flappy bird. It was a simple yet captivating game that caught the attention of millions of people and was one of the first games to go viral. So, due to its simplicity I want to create a game similar to flappy bird. I am planning on calling this game "Astro-man". The idea is to have an astronaut flying through space on a jet pack, and have them navigate through various obstacles with the aim of surviving the longest.

I understand that there will be many challenges, I am not sure if I can code all the functionality, or that if turtle even supports creating a game like this. However, I will try my best and try to learn as much as possible. 

I want to start off by creating a floating person, who can be controlled with keypresses to make them go up or down. Then I plan on implementing gravity somehow and simulate falling down. Third I will figure out how I can get the astronaut to move forward. Finally, I will add obstacles and the logic of collision and ending the game. 

One of the toughest challenges in front of me is to figure out the logic of placing the obstacles so that the game is "winnable", but also hard enough to be enjoyable. I intend to find out more as I work on this project, and hopefully create a game I can enjoy.
