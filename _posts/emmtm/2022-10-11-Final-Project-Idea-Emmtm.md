I will be creating a program that gives users a tarot card reading in response to a brief questionnaire requiring user input. The program will ask users simple questions about their age, relationship status, and what kind of reading they are looking for (personal, relationship, or professional). The program will then use this context to pull three tarot cards for a simple past, present, and future reading about the user selected scenario. I will be using the .random module to pick the cards as well as some Boolean loops to determine what copy will be given to the user based on their answers as well as the random cards picked. The idea is to begin creating simple algorithms that can take user input and put that data into predetermined contexts to provide a uniquely different outcome upon each use of the program. 

To achieve this I will have to develop:
-A variety of short meanings for each card in the context of each user scenario. As there are 72 card total as well as two meanings for each card I will be developing a mad-lib style template for the tarot reading output for the program to take simple context words (3-4 words each/one sentence max) for each card to generate a robust looking reading while cutting down on the copywriting work
-A questionnaire for the user
-Visual representation of each card
-A module to store these &:  
  -A function that will randomize the cards and choose the correct corresponding data set for the user input 
  -I will making this in a Turtle based program as a twist on the “game” concept while including a bit of knowledge from the data analysis side to make generating the readings a bit more intuitive for the program.
