What excites you?

At the moment, implementing customer discovery and user interviews is exciting to me. Additionally, surveys and thinking about qualitative research is fun for me. 

What info do you need to decide?

I need to research further to find out what types of python projects would look impressive in my portfolio. 

What type of project will you pick?

I think I want to focus on a data processing project but I'm not too sure. If there is a turtle project that seems interesting, I would be open to contemplating it.

What project will you pick?

I'm not sure 100% but I am leaning towards a data proceeding project analyzing survey data on python.


Reflection

After evaluating my initial idea, the project ended up being too difficult for me to execute due to limited time coupled with my basic knowledge of python coding. It was to compile my surveys and create a menu with options to find answer to survey questions and pair the answers with participant email addresses. My problem was that I have about 4 different surveys with less than 10 participants with a total of about 35-40 questions. It was going to be too complicated for me so I wanted to be more realistic and decided to move forward with my back up plan.



New Plan

I have a CSV file with 100 participants which fell in line with our requirement. I need to be able to retrieve their contact information and volunteer survey status.I referred to our in class i-shcool CSV assignment and watched our class video to help me plan my project.  My objectives are listed below:
