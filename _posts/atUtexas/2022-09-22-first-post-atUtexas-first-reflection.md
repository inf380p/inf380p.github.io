Title: "My First Reflection on the Class so Far"
---

**Reflection**

Lightbulb Moment: 
At the beginning of this course, I felt very intimated by the subject matter. As I have begun to dive into the fundamentals, I feel more at ease. Whenever I start a study session, I do feel overwhelmed by my lack of knowledge of the material. However, I understand each topic better once I’ve studied each concept. I like the interactive book and find it a beneficial resource.

Describe some confusion you’ve experienced. Did it help you learn?:
When I find myself confused, I review the glossary to refresh my memory on all the definitions. I have found this to be helpful when trying to understand a concept. 

What is still fuzzy for you? What will you do to make sure you can resolve your fuzziness?:
I do find some of the concepts a bit fuzzy. I feel that things are moving relatively fast in this course, so things may sometimes feel overwhelming. I do think that it is due to a lack of continuous practice. I try to practice more in the areas that I find challenging. I keep thinking about how learning python is like learning a foreign language. The more you practice, the more it stays with you.

Problem-solving strategies:
I watch many YouTube videos to help refresh my memory or view a concept explained in detail in different ways. I’ve learned that I am more of a visual learner. I need visuals when a concept is presented for better understanding. 

Here is my first code example:

The Code for my second example Looks like this:

```python
score = int(input ("Enter your final exam score:"))

if score > 100 or score < 0:
    print ("This number is invalid")
elif score >= 70:
    print ("You have passed this class!")
    print ("You can now apply for Graduation:)")
    
else:
  print ("Sorry, you have failed this class.")
  print ("You must retake this course.")
  ```
  
  Thanks for reading!
