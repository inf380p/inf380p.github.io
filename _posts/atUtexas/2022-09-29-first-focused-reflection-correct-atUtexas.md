 #Setback

 While working on the click turtles assignment, I experienced a setback. I was trying to figure out what I was doing wrong without any luck. I felt very frustrated and panicked.  I emailed Professor Elliott with my issue with my flower with the yellow fill.  I had noticed I’d been sitting in my chair for about 3 hours without a break. I experienced the same issue the previous day so I was feeling extremely frustrated. I finally decided to do something else. When I returned to my assignment a few hours later. I felt refreshed and was quickly able to solve my issue and felt really stupid for the simple error. I was using a server-side trinket instead of the one we have been using for Turtle. 

 #Lessons Learned

 What really stuck with me was that taking breaks and getting some fresh air and exercise is helpful when coding for extended periods of time. 

 Debugging is an important part of the process. Also, I noticed that in order to get my desired function, I have a hard time figuring out what needs to be coded. I have a certain idea in mind but it’s hard to transpose that to code. Getting started is my biggest challenge.

 My original Idea was to have the clicky turtles draw the grass and mountains. I don’t think I have time to complete this one in time to post this.  However, I will keep working on it.  In the meantime, you’ll see Turtles Tina and Tommy with a red and yellow flower.  Tina is an onclick and Tommy is an onkey.

 #Fun

 I did enjoy working on my star. I wish the speed could be faster though. Here is the code for my star:


 ```
 turtle.color("red")
 turtle.begin_fill()
 turtle.speed(10)

 for i in range(110):
     turtle.forward(200)
     turtle.left(168)
     
     
 turtle.color("yellow")
 turtle.end_fill()
 turtle.done()
  
  
 ```


  Here is the complete code:
