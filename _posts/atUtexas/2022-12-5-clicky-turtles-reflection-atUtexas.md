#New Projects


 I decided to create a mountain range. Surprisingly, this was an easy task for me. I understand now how coding relates to patterns, just like patters in music with certain etudes. I did use a loop for my triangles. I would like to also add a sky, sun and grass.  Here is my loop.
 ```
 for i in [0, 1, 2]:               
     mountain.forward(175)
     mountain.left(120)
 mountain.end_fill()

 ```



 Another new project I would like to consider is a graph. I have been compiling several surveys for a UX research project and would like to have basic foundational knowledge as to how create a chart or graph on python.

 This week I found myself feeling frustrated with Chapter 5 exercises in our online book. I took a step back and will take a break for a few days before I go back to work on them.

 Additionally, I looked over Elliottâ€™s videos on Vimeo. Im going to spend some time reviewing his videos to see if they are helpful for me.

 Here is my link to view the mountains:
