## How did it go?
It went pretty well. The meetup I went to was hosted by CSSA(Chinese Student Scholar Association) about how to do better coding interviews using Python. 
They invited a couple of Software Engineers from FAANG and one from Google told us to only use Python to do the tech interviews.

## What did you learn?
- Python is the best language for coding interviews
- The tech interviewer only cares about your thoughts. They don't care which language you use to code
- Python write significantlly less code then all the other languages like Java and C++
- There are a lot of short cut you can use in Python, and it will increase your coding performance

## Would you find value in this kind of event after class?
Yes. It helped me learn more about coding interviews and the kinds of abilities I should present during them.

## How was the experience different from your expectations?
I expect they will do some live coding stuff, but they just showed us a bunch of PPTs.

## Could you see yourself becomming a member of a professional community like this in the future?
Yes I will. After I become an export in coding interviews, and start working for one of the FAANG companies.
