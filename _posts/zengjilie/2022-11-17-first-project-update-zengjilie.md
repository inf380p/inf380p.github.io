## Purposal Recap
I want to make a simply command-line interface that displays information about the top 100 Youtube Channels.

## Todo List Check
[+] Find Website to collect data from.
- Data source --> https://socialblade.com/youtube/top/100

[+] Using `BeautifulSoup` to parse **HTML** raw data
- Finished `getData.py` to parse all the data in `Data_Top_100.txt` and store csv data in `Youtube_Data.csv` 
- 
[ ] Combine `Youtube_Data.csv` and `Grade_Data.csv` and `Type_Data.csv`

[ ] Build command-line user interface

## Setbacks/Difficulties
- It's pretty tricky and time-consuming to figure out the right reguar expression to use during the process
- I need to learn some concepts of web development, such as css styles and block elements like div and span
- Setup the python environment is also pretty hard for me, I need to learn how to use Mac terminal commands like `homebrew`
