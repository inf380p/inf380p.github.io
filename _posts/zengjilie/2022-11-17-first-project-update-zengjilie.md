## Proposal Recap
I want to make a simply command-line interface that displays facts about the top 100 Youtube Channels.

## Todo List Check
- [x] Find Website to collect data. )
- [x] Using `BeautifulSoup` to parse **HTML** raw data
- [ ] Store data in csv files
- [ ] Command-line user interface
- [ ] Provide answers to each questions
- [ ] Print Bueautifier
- [ ] Add wait time to mimic data fetching 

## Setbacks/Difficulties
- It's pretty tricky and time-consuming to figure out the right regular expression to use when parsing **HTML** file
- I need to learn some concepts of web development, such as css styles and block elements like div and span
- Setup the python environment is also pretty hard for me, I need to learn how to use Mac terminal commands like `homebrew` and `pip` to install the right python environment and packages
