## The project
I'm creating a D&D-style text based adventure game called Dungeon Crawl.
The idea is to let the player choose a class, journey through a dungeon fighting
enemies and solving puzzles, and eventually level up enough to defeat the boss.

## How it's going
So far, I have the base player class, most of the actual classes, and the menus 
worked out. The game runs, the player can set their name and class, and the game 
can continue/restart/exit from the menus. The player can also select actions from 
the game menu, but most currently just have placeholder text.

## Immediate plans
The thing I'm currently working on is finishing up the player classes and making 
the enemy classes. I have to figure out the basic game loop for combat and how 
I'm going to save the game state. After that, I'll need to write some room descriptions 
and design some encounters.

## Possible goals
If I get everything working the way that I want, I'll also try to add in more enemy 
types, more puzzles, and maybe multiple enemies per encounter. 

## Roadblocks
I've had other classes demanding most of my time, so I haven't gotten much work 
done on this since the week of Thanksgiving. However, that's mostly cleared up 
now, so I'm confident I'll be able to put some hours in this weekend.

## Milestones
### Ambitious enough?
I think so. It'll be a fully functional game with several classes for replayability.
It won't be massive or ready for a public release or anything, but it'll accomplish 
the goals I set out with.

### Too ambitious?
Possibly. I'm not entirely sure how I'll do some of the things I'm planning, but 
I've never really let that stop me before. I'm confident I'll be able to figure 
something out for the rest of my ideas, and there's no shortage of tutorials online 
if I get stuck.

### Able to keep to the plan?
Probably. Outside of some unforeseen emergency, I fully expect to be able to finish 
as intended.

## Current prototype
Here's the current version:
