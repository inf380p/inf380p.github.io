## San Diego Python Monthly Meetup
For my meetup, I decided to attend the San Diego Python Monthly Meetup on 17 November
2022. I didn't originally plan to attend this meetup specifically, but the first two 
for which I signed up were cancelled. I'm happy I got to attend this one, and it
was pretty different from my expectations.

### Mostly presentations
The first surprise was that this meetup mainly comprised two presentations from
members of the group. I had expected it to be a bit more interactive, but it seems
like they trade off between these presentation meetings and more collaborative
sessions for working on projects. I think this was still a good experience, but
I'd like to try a collaborative meetup in the future to see how it compares.

### First talk: Jay Miller on GitHub Issues
The first presentation was by Jay Miller. He mainly discussed GitHub issues, specifically
the ability to create issue templates and how to retrieve issue information using
an API. I thought this presentation was interesting because he showed both the 
issues on GitHub and the code that he wrote in real time to make an API call that
retrieved the issue title. It was nice to see him write the code for the API call
as it happened because it showed how simple the process really was. I'm not sure 
exactly what use I would get out of the package he demonstrated, but I'll keep it
in mind in case something comes up in the future.

### Second talk: Drew Arnett on the Experimental Contest Logger
The second presentation was by Drew Arnett. He's an amateur radio enthusiast and
he helped create a program in Python that allows for automating a lot of common
tasks related to amateur radio contests. For example, he was able to automatically
send and receive callsign information in Morse Code by pressing a button. The Morse 
Code he received was decoded into text, and the program even displayed information 
like the caller's location based on the callsign prefix. It also used a database 
of known contest participants to reference the callsign in case he had connected 
to them before.

### Not just code
Drew's presentation really surprised me because it felt like more of a radio presentation 
than a Python presentation. He was demonstrating Python software, but most of the 
talk focused on the background of amateur radio contests and the hardware setup 
he used with the program. He did show off how it worked and discussed the benefits 
over others he had tried, but I just wasn't expecting something like that from a 
Python meetup. It was cool to see how something he helped write could interface 
with several pieces of hardware to make a real world task much easier.

### Value after class
I could see meetups being valuable beyond this class, especially if I find one 
that focuses on my specific interests. Something like a data science meetup would 
be really useful for my career in the future, but something fun for personal projects 
would also be nice. I have a project on the back burner that involves scraping a 
website for forum information and then using that to calculate the results of posted 
polls.

### Final thoughts
Overall, I'm happy with my first meetup experience. I'm excited to see what other 
meetup opportunities I can find, and I'm especially interested in finding one to 
help me work through a couple of personal projects I've been working on.
