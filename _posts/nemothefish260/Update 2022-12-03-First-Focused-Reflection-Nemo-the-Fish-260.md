# **Nemothefish260's First Focused Reflection**

## Some context

I am a firm believer that good things are difficult and require the willingness to go through the motions. This is my first semester as a grad student abroad and the past
few months have included several learning curves. I hope I am not coming off as too dramatic in this post. With that said, this major transition alongside the change from
literature and queer rights-related research for a non-profit in my homecountry (which restricts women's mobility and education, etc. since it''s the Islamic Republic) to
living independently here and learning technical things has been painstakingly hard but also enormously rewarding.

I started this course with the assumption that coding is a rigid and conservative exercise that requires innate knowledge and the ability to strike at the right answer
in one go. However, as I have learnt, it is like slow burn film. One must take one's time with it. Struggling is crucial to the process, and so is clicking "Run".

## First introductions

I remember the first time I wrote a program. It drew a panda. I have lost the code since but I remember struggling to find the coordinate as I wished that there
were some magic function that would give me all the right answers. Now I know that there are multiple ways I can go about coding anything, even if it's the face
of a panda, and I don't need to necessarily hardcode my coordinates. At the same time, the most fun I have had is creating loops that allows me to draw multiple
things with very few lines of code. The efficiency and unpredictability excites me. Additionally, I think that I have gotten better at visualizing what the shape
of my program *can* be. This lets me control the code, rather than let the code control me and the flow of my product.

An example of some of my first attempts at drawing a scenery is linked below:

I drew these clouds with great difficulty ( a small slice of the required code is given below):

```
#Cloud2
tip.penup()
tip.color("white")
tip.goto(40,65)
tip.pendown()
tip.fillcolor("white")
tip.begin_fill()
tip.circle(10)
tip.end_fill()

tip.penup()
tip.color("white")
tip.goto(0,95)
tip.pendown()
tip.fillcolor("white")
tip.begin_fill()
tip.circle(15)
tip.end_fill()
```

## One glowing lightbulb

In contrast to this, I have linked my CSV File Explorer program, which is not perfect, but certainly shows how my planning skills and knowledge of different functions
have improved over time:

https://github.com/inf380p/inf380p.github.io/pull/424

This program is probably the favorite piece I have composed so far because it includes everything a literature major *should* hate: data, lists, CODE and the meticulous
task of cleaning data. However, the process of writing it was far more creative and similar to the work of a UX designer - the specialization I am currently pursuing.

## Thank you's
Lastly. I'd like to thank my classmates (Soojin, JP, Prakash, Hannah, Rosalind and anyone who was a kind presence) as well as Prof. Eliot who humanized the process of
programming for me with the acknowledgment that everyone interacts with tech differently due to an extremely gendered digital divide.
