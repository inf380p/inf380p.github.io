### Are there any roadblocks ahead? Is there anything your group can do to help out?
Since I am working on a dataset that has around 8000 rows, trinket has been very slow for me. I am worried if my goal of running a regression model would be possible on trinket. 

### Are your milestones ambitious enough? Make sure to include some stretch goals.

I believe my milestone is ambitious. I have noticed that since pandas make life very easy, it is considerably easy to do data preprocessing and exploratory analysis.
But, sklearn is not enabled on trinket, and I have started coding from scratch (removing outliers, plotting the best fit line for regression).
The stretch goal is to code from scratch a regression model, for two variables.

### Are your milestones too ambitious? Make sure to break down the unglamorous parts of coding into chunks that reflect the actual work to be done.
My goals are a little ambitious.
I intend to do a thorough job in data preprocessing, AND also visualize the outliers and the data. I also then intend to build a regression model from scratch.

First I imported the data and converted it to a dataframe, in order to easily filter and manipulate the data.
I visualized and removed the outliers from the column (asthma) using boxplot and IQR method.
I intend to also map a correlation matrix to see how my target variable is affected by the columns.
Once that is done, I intend to run statistical models to gain more detailed insights.

### Are you able to keep to your plan? Looking back at what youâ€™ve actually done, is the difference accountable to bad planning (i.e. not anticipating what needed to be done), bad execution (not doing it), or something else?
I didn't anticipate trinket to be this slow. I think I would have been able to do better if I could on jupyter notebook. I also took for granted how easy python libraries make our lives. sklearn is predominantly used for data science, and I wish I could use it on trinket. 
Since I have gotten better at debugging after gaining knowledge from this class, I find myself commiting lesser errors!
