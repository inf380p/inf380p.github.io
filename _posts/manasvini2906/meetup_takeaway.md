### How did it go?
On November 15 on the Meetup platform, I attended the Data Science Austin Meetup. As an aspiring data scientist, it was a wonderful experience! I use pandas, numpy regularly but the meeting improved my fundamental knowledge about these libraries.

### What did you learn?
The meeting was a fundamentals solidifying sessions for me. I often used to find myself having problems with filtering data, using iloc loc etc. The meeting was useful in me gaining an additional perspective to how I can approach problems. Researching on the capabilities of libraries was encouraged!

### Would you find value in this kind of event after class?
The value of this event was to gain perspective on the subject from people who work in different industries.

### How was the experience different from your expectations?
It was different in the way it eased me in, since I was a little overwhelmed.

### Could you see yourself becomming a member of a professional community like this in the future?
Yes, for sure! I would love to contribute to the Data Science community after gaining adequate knomwledge.
