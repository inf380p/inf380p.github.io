#Reflection:

*While* I completed the CSV To-Dos, I learned a lot. I have always struggled with defining functions, and I could feel the newly developed confidence this time. 
Caring about indentation and dealing with every error I got because of it made me slight more detail oriented than I was before.


```
menu_dict = {
  "1" : "Browse rows of data",
  "2" : "Print specific row",
  "3" : "Select columns to print",
  "4" : "Change data file"
}
```
Here I defined get_data to get the list of dictionaries and I got a lot of errors because of improper indentation. I have become better at catching my errors now!

```
def get_dict(filename):
  # Get a list of dictionaries from CSV file
  with open(filename) as file:
    reader = csv.DictReader(file)
    row_dicts_list = list(reader)
  # Headers of the CSV are the keys of any row dictionary
  # Get the keys from the first row
  headers = row_dicts_list[0].keys()
  
  return row_dicts_list, headers
  
row_dicts_list, headers = get_dict(filename)
```
I kept getting a Name Error here! It was because I used "get_col" instead of "get_cols". Again, since I was familiar with what Name Error means, I could find the error easily.
```
  cols = []
  def get_cols(row_dicts_list, headers):
  # Let user choose which columns to print, or print them all
  if interface.input_is_yes(f"File '{filename}' has {len(headers)} columns. Select which columns to print?\n", default = "y"):
    for header in headers:
      selected = interface.input_is_yes(f"Do you want {header} in simplified print view?", default = 'y')
      if selected:
        cols.append(header)
  else:
    print("All columns will be printed")
    cols = headers
  return columns
columns_to_print = get_cols(row_dicts_list, headers)
```


This exercise made me realize that I can handle errors better now! I hope to reduce the number of errors I make though.
