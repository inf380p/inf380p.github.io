title: Initial Idea for Project

#ProjectIdea <br>

I am intending to choose the **data analysis** path for my project since it aligns with my interest in becoming a data scientist. I would love to put my knowledge to a noble cause like climate change. 
I would source environmental data and learn on my way to explore and derive insights from it.

Methodology:

Clean and preprocess the data, and perform exploratory analysis on it. Since I also have an interest in statistics, I would try to understand regression models and try to run it on my data.

To do:

* Source reliable data
* Study about the columns and understand the data
* Visualize the data and derive insights
* Run regression model (if possible)
The project would be done on python, using it's packages like seaborn and pandas.
