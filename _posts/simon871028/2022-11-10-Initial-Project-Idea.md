### Project Type and Idea

I plan to work on data analysis project on NBA players data from 2021-2022 season.
Analyze player's efficiency and provide advanced stats through data visualization library (matplotlib).

The reason why I am doing this project is that I am such a big basketball fan, I would like to use this opportunity
to gain more insights from the players' stats and help others to interpret the raw data more easily.

### Milestones

1. Find valid datasets from either Kaggle.com or other 3rd party gathered datasets.
2. Think of what kind of advanced statistic results I would like to visualize and can provide meaningful insights.
3. Start the data cleaning/exploratory.
4. Visualize the data.
