** Reflection

I have been enjoying this course so far. 
Mr. Hauser has used a very interesting and interactive way to introduce us into the world of Python.
Although I've already got some experience in Python, I still get to learn something new such as using Trinket.
The Github tutorial and excercise is very helpful and useful as well.
Looking foward to learning new things in the following classes with Mr. Hauser.
