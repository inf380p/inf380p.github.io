## Learnings

* Dealing with CSV files is one of the most crucial part for me as a student who is currently on Data Science track in this program. It's very interesting and refreshing to get all these hands-on experience here.

* Spent a lot of time trying to understand how `interface.py` works.

* Learned how to use python library `glob` to get all the files within the same directory based on their extensions.

```python
csvs_list = glob.glob(r"*.csv")
```
* Learned the basic features of a dictionary. Understood that it's a pair of key-value item and it's similiar to map in C++.
  
```python
# key = "number , value = 8
dic = { "number": 8 }
```

## Code

Intially, it's hard for me to figure out where to put the `while` loop. After trying multiple times, I figured that I should put it outside the 
```python
choice_str = interface.get_menu_choice(menu_dict, prompt_str = ">>>")
```.
