## How did it go?

I attended a meetup with software engineers and hiring managers from Indeed, Expedia, Paypal and Google at Indeed's headquarter on September 10th.
The meeting focus on how we can use Python to comprehend the concept of the coding interviews.
It went smoothly, I enjoyed the Meetup and expanded my connections through the meetup.



## What did you learn?
- Python has subjectively better readability among other programming languages.
- Python has a lot of build-in functions/ methods that we can use without calling / importing libraries, which makes it very convenient.
- Python has some downsides such as higher runtime compared to C++/Jave/C.
- Expressing the thinking process and interactive with the interviewer is also a crucial part during the coding interview.
- Having a great concept of Object Oriented Programming on Python would be great.

## Would you find value in this kind of event after class?
- Networking is a important part in this event. We got to meet a lot of people from the same background and we are all pursuing the same career after graduation.It's great to make friends that can work together toward the same goal.
- Get to know how the interviewers think of interviewees from their perspective is very interesting.

## How was the experience different from your expectations?

I didn't expect them to do the live coding. But they did open an IDE and showcased how their approaches are when doing a coding interview.

## Could you see yourself becomming a member of a professional community like this in the future?
Yes. I would be more than happy to contribute back to the community in the future if I have the opportunity.
