## What decides My Initial Project Idea
- **What excites me**
   * As a future software engineer, I focus on users' experiences. Also, I always show a strong ownership on my program and want to make my program perfect. With this spirit, I would like to write a program that allows the user to have a good interaction process and feel relaxed and happy when using it. 

- **What information helps me to decide**
   
   * Reviewing my past learning modules about Turtle, I have completed a lot of fantasic programs. I even wrote a little game of snake eating in turtle. Although it was only a half-finished product, through the progress, I felt how exciting it is to write a program that gives the user a great experience. So, I choose Turtle project as my final project. 


## Initial Project Idea and Milestone
- **Level 1**
    * I would like to program a tetris game with Turtle. The basic rules of this game are very familiar to everyone. You can control each square by the arrow keys. And when you successfully eliminate a layer you can get points. 
- **Level 2**
    * Based on Level 1, I want to make it more diversified gameplay. The space bar can pause the falling blocks, and the c key can change the shape of the blocks. As the score increases, the speed of falling blocks will increase and the difficulty will increase.

## Work Plan
1. Review previous Turtle modules and read more materials about Turtle.(Week 1)
2. Break down each feature of this game.（Week 1）
3. Design the initial state of the game, including background, size, color, etc.(week 2)
4. Design an initial game that includes only basic control, movement, elimination, and scoring features.(week 2)
5. Focus on finishing Level 1 and make a reflection.(Week 3)
6. Move on to Level 2. Design advanced functions about changing the shapes of blocks, the speed of falling blocks and the difficulty of the game.(Week 4)
7. Finish Level 2 and make a reflection.(Week 4,5)
