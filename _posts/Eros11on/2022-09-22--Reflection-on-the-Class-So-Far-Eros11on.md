## Reflection
- _**From the beginning to now, this class,INF380P, has been my favorite class!**_ ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©

   1. The novel teaching style of this class was a light bulb for me in learning programming. For example,I took a similar programming class in my undergraduate years, but the teaching style was that the teacher just asked us to read a paper textbook and then gave us a lecture based on the chapter content. After class,he would leave some theoretical assignments for us to do. There was few opportunities for us to program. 
   However, this class was different. I found that all the teaching materials were on a website, and we could code just in the website and even contribute to the website , which was really cool for me. And this style really stimulated my interest in learning programming.
   
   2. I've written some small programs in Python before, but this is the first time I've used turtle, and it's really cool. But in learning turtle, I also faced some problems at first. For example, I would like to drew a dazzling figure, but I couldn't make it. After consulting related materials, I got the following code.
    ```tina.penup()<br>
       tina.goto(0,-100)
       tina.pendown()
       tina.pensize(2)
       tina.color('violet')
       for i in range(90):
          tina.circle(i*1,60)
     ```
          
  
   * At first I didn't understand the meaning of the loop, but after I understood the meaning of the parameters in the "circle" function, I learned that ```"circle(i*1,60)"``` means taking a point on the Y-axis from 1 to 90 pixels away from the turtle as a circle, and draw an arc with a radian of 60Â° and repeats 90 times. It was an unforgettable learning experience for me, it taught me how to search for answers to my questions more efficiently by using related websites. Alos it taught me that every program has a specific meaning behind it, which will help me in my next studies.



   3. But in the process of learning turtle, there are still some problems that confuse me. For example, if I want to draw a complex picture, I need to modify the code again and again to debug a little bit and finally get the effect I want, such as the following code.

     * This is a cherry tree dropping its petals, and I need to keep debugging the code to make it look more natural and realistic, which often takes a lot of time. Is there any way to improve efficiency?

- _**I think strong information retrieval skills help me a lot in my study, and how to search for questions correctly and efficiently is a key step. Also constant questioning is another good strategy for problem solving. For example, when I encounter some technical problems, I like to search and ask questions on some websites like stackflow, codeproject, github and so on, where there are thousands of people who love programming like me to learn and communicate with each other.ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª**_
