* This is a cherry tree dropping its petals, and I need to keep debugging the code to make it look more natural and realistic, which often takes a lot of time. Is there any way to improve efficiency?

_**I think strong information retrieval skills help me a lot in my study, and how to search for questions correctly and efficiently is a key step. Also constant questioning is another good strategy for problem solving. For example, when I encounter some technical problems, I like to search and ask questions on some websites like stackflow, codeproject, github and so on, where there are thousands of people who love programming like me to learn and communicate with each other.ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª**_
