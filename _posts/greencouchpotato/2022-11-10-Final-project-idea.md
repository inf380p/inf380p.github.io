### Project Working On 
 I'd like to work on a turtle program for my final project. I however do not yet have a clear picture on what the game would be like in detail.

 ### What Excites Me?
I think getting creative with challenges excites me the most. Creating endless possibilities is something I can do with the game that I'll design for the project.

 ### What do I need to help decide?
I need some help with understanding how complex the game needs to be, what makes an interactive program good, and how can I organise my code since it would be longer than usual this time.

 ### Milestones
 1. I need to brainstorm and decide on what kind of game I'd like to build.
 2. Then I need to decide what functions would be required for each level and what modules I need to import.
 3. Then I can work on building the actual code and debugging as I go.
