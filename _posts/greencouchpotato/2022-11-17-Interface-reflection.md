###Introduction
I'm currently thinking of working on a turtle program for my final project. I'm thinking of an interactive game with multiple levels where the user can use keys and mouseclicks to play the game.

###Progress
I'm considering doing a hangman game that let's a user enter the alphabets while playing the game. I will use a pre-set of random words that I will call using the random function.
The user can start guessing the word based on the hint given.
Below is a snip of how I'd like my game to look like -

1. I'd like to import a random functions and feed some words and hints into the code
2. I'd then create a UI element to set the visuals for the game
3. I believe most of my work requires if/elif funtion because it's a trial and error game.
4. It has about 10 levels and a use has n number of chances to determine the correct word.

###Next steps

I'm working on building the code for this. I'll have to import a random function and a clickable alphabet "buttons" that the user can click on.
The complexity of the word will increase as they go. I'm planning to put 10 levels in my code overall. I need to figure out if I should have a clickable alphabet button/if I should let the user enter an alphabet using their keypad.

I'd like to confirm if this work is complex enough for the final project.
