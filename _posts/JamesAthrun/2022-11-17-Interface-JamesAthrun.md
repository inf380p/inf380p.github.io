I have already finished one simple game of tic-tac-toe.
It is available for two game players to play around. The game will finish as soon as one of the plalyers wins or the two players tie.

What I'm going to do is to create a computer player so that the game do not necessary need two players. One player can have a game with the computer.
I'll create a button at the beginning of the game to let the users choose whether they would like to play with another player or to play with the computer.
I'm also trying to set the computer to different levels, like easy mode and difficult mode, which may make the game more interesting.
