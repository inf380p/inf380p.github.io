I am going to choose to do turtle.
When I was in my middle school, I used to play a chessboard game which is similar to a high-level tic-tac-toe game called zen. It is a more complex version which contains nine tic-tac-toe in one chessboard. It is also a two-player game and the rules is similar to the original version. However, I could no longer find this game online. So I would like to create a version of my own using turtle.

My project timeline:

This week:
Build a prototype for tic-tac-toe using turtle. Build a 3*3 chessboard and set up the winning rules.

Second week:
Try to build a computer player for user to play against with on the original tic-tac-toe game

Third week and forth week:
Expand the chessboard from 3*3 to 9*9.
Set up the rules for the complicated version of the game.
I do think this is a difficult part because I'm not sure about how to deal with the complicated animations when deploying the game. But I'll try my best to deal with it and try to create a game which is similar to what I remember.
