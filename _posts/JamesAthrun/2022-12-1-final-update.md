### Are there any roadblocks ahead? Is there anything your group can do to help out?
Currenntly there is no roadblocks. I have already reached my previous goals to create the baseline of my project, including the player vs player part and player vs computer part.

### Are your milestones ambitious enough? Make sure to include some stretch goals.
I believe my milestone is ambitious enough. The main challenging was to make the computer ai. I have searched on the Internet for some strategies for computer ai in tic-tac-toe games. I have tried a strategy called minmax strategy. But I failed due to some error in the algorithm. As a result, I created a new strategy for the computer ai and seemingly this one is a high-level ai which is able to compete with human.

### Are your milestones too ambitious? Make sure to break down the unglamorous parts of coding into chunks that reflect the actual work to be done.
The previous milestones are not too ambitious. But the my goal to create a whole advanced game than tic-tac-toe is something can not be done only use turtle. Many other packages may be imported to finish this goal. As a result, I may change my follow up milestone to make this game a more user-friendly interface, and provide users with more options with the chessboard color, etc. I will also try to improve the user experience of the game. 

### Are you able to keep to your plan? Looking back at what youâ€™ve actually done, is the difference accountable to bad planning (i.e. not anticipating what needed to be done), bad execution (not doing it), or something else?
Despite the future changes, I am able to keep to my plan. The final goal may be too ambitious for me to finish. But I have changed my plan and I think it is achievable.
