### Are there any roadblocks ahead? Is there anything your group can do to help out?
In the Data Science Python Meetup I attended, someone suggested using me to use Plotly to create visualizations, so I watched a couple of tutorials on Plotly to see how I could create plots with it. Later, I discovered that Trinket does not support it, so I switched to matplotlib instead. I began learning more about matplotlib and have done fairly well thus far. Aside from that, the only issue I'm having is not being able to see multiple visualizations on Trinket. Normally, it is fairly simple to plot and view graphs in Python notebooks because they are all drawn through different cells in the notebook, but in Trinket, I am only able to view one plot at a time, despite the presence of the entire code. For the time being, in Trinket, I always have to  ensure that I only leave the code for the desired visualization uncommented and leave the rest commented to ensure that one specific visualization appears and appears properly. This is something I need to look into.

### Are your milestones ambitious enough? Make sure to include some stretch goals.
Yes, I believe my goals are sufficiently ambitious. However, if anyone believes otherwise, I'd appreciate some feedback. I still need to make some more plots to investigate things like:
* How do Virat Kohli's strike rates differ when he bats in the first versus second innings?
* Which teams does he prefer to play against, i.e. which teams does he score the most against?
* Virat Kohli's number of centuries while batting in the first and second innings
* The types of dismissals that Virat Kohli faced the majority of the time

### Are your milestones too ambitious? Make sure to break down the unglamorous parts of coding into chunks that reflect the actual work to be done.
My goals are not overly ambitious in my opinion. I intend to use bar charts to analyze his performance in the first and second innings (strike rates, centuries, runs scored). I intend to use a pie chart in the section where I analyze how much he gets out while batting. I also intend to use pandas to filter data and create visualizations tailored to specific scenarios. I'll probably do some data frame slicing and visualizations on top of that for this.

### Are you able to keep to your plan? Looking back at what you’ve actually done, is the difference accountable to bad planning (i.e. not anticipating what needed to be done), bad execution (not doing it), or something else?
Aside from the fact that I'm having trouble ensuring that all visualizations appear on Trinket and not just any one of them, I've met my expectations in terms of my goals. I'm sticking to the objectives I set for this project. I do encounter minor stumbling blocks, such as not always being able to figure out how to create specific plots or how to use specific parameters for specific use cases. However, searching on the web and going through matplotlib's official documentation always solves the problem.
