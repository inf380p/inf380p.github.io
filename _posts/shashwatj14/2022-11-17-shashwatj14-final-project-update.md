So I've been working on a Data Analysis project with a cricket player dataset in the form of a csv file. 

I began by importing two required packages: pandas and matplotlib. I use pandas for data manipulation, such as importing csv data with the pd.read_csv function, viewing the top 5 rows of a dataset with the head function, and many other tasks. Matplotlib will be used to generate plots. I haven't made any plots yet to analyze Virat Kohli's performance. But I'll be making more plots to see patterns in the data and discover some interesting insights, such as:

1. Trend of runs scored by Virat Kohli in his career from 18 August 2008 to 22 January 2017.
2. All batting positions that Virat Kohli has played in.
3. Total runs scored by Virat Kohli in different positions.
4. The number of centuries scored by Virat Kohli while batting in both the first and second innings.
5. Kind of dismissals Virat Kohli faced most of the time.
6. Against which team did Virat Kohli score the majority of his runs?

Please let me know if you have any suggestions for me or how I should approach this project. I'd be delighted to incorporate any constructive feedback to improve my project and the analysis that I'm conducting.
