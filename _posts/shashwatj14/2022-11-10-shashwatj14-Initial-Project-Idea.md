#ProjectIdea <br>
For the final project, I'll be conducting data analysis on one of my favorite cricket players (a sport that I regularly follow), Virat Kohli. Viral Kohli is a true game changer, and I've been following him since his first cricket match in 2011. The goal of this project is to evaluate his performance. I have the dataset in the form of a csv file, which contains statistics demonstrating his performance on the pitch. My dataset includes the following features:

1. Runs: In-game runs
2. BF: Match balls encountered
3. 4s: the number of 4s in a game.
4. 6s: the number of 6s in a game.
5. Strike Rate (SR) in the match
6. Position: Batting

I want to delve deep into his performance and uncover some intriguing insights, such as which opponents he prefers to play against, his preferred batting positions, how he gets out, and how frequently he remains not out. I'd also like to know how his strike rate differs between the first and second innings. For the time being, these are the questions on my mind, but I am sure that as I delve deeper into this analysis, more and more will arise. I'd probably use python packages like pandas and matplotlib for the analysis in this project.
