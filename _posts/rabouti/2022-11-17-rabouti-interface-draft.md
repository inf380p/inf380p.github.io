## Reflection
It’s been rather difficult for me to decide which direction I want to go with my game because most of my ideas and visions have been overly ambitious. Therefore, I have adjusted my expectations and plans in order to come up with an original game that exemplifies my abilities (i.e., efficacy) and satisfies all of the project requirements. 

I finally decided to pursue a treasure hunt game (coupled with the user answering riddles in order to access the various screen/levels). My new plan is to create a game where the user selects a door and each door corresponds to a “realm” - each realm varies in difficulty and the user must find where the “golden goose" is hiding (behind images or shapes - to be determined) in each realm (i.e., the treasure). I would like each realm to have a riddle for the user to solve before embarking on the "golden goose" chase.

After the user's door selection (via input), the game presents the user with a riddle in order to grant access to the “realm” that corresponds to each “door.” With click events, the user will click various objects/images to unveil where the “golden goose” is hiding. When the user finds the goose, then they can “win” in that realm and obtain one bar of gold (scoring to be implemented next). In order to "win," you must collect 3 bars of gold from the goose in each realm. Once the user has located the gold in the realm they selected, you will automatically go back to the main screen and select another door to keep adding to your score until you "win" (winning score = 3). I would like to implement a limit for the number of guesses you can use to find the golden goose, but that idea may be too ambitious. 

## Milestones
- Further develop interface
- Create menu for user to select "door"
- Create different feautures within each realm upon selecting the door 
- Implement method for scoring and winning

## Roadblocks
Currently, the roadblocks ahead include figuring out how to execute code that appropriately matches the intended results and outcomes and using the correct order of operations - and just staying on top of everything while being organized and efficient. Additionally, I need to learn how to load images to Python and intentionally weave images into my program. Moreover, I have not figured out how to weave in the use of files....

I’m still tweaking all of the details and am excited to further develop my plans. Unfortunately, I still think my plan is slightly too ambitious, so I am still making adjustments. 

###### Here is an initial sketch I made and have plans to add to:

I plan to weave in Dr. Hauser's code from the class website to construct a program with "treasure hunt" features. Under each line of code where the program "prints" after the user selects which door, I plan to "print" a background screen with all of the features I want in the corresponding door's "realm." 

Being in a group will be helpful in the event that I have questions regarding varying potentialities about my game. I appreciate the diverse range of knowledge and fluency in code within my group.

Before next class I intend to put my interface in a while loop and enlist dictionaries. Additiolnally, I will have my main screen aesthetic with each door, each riddle defined, create the aesthetics of each realm corresponding to each door, implement custom component for clickable objects within each realm (that correspond to the "treasure), and implement scoring and winning screen.  


# Revised

## Milestones - Work to be done
- Create menu with dictionary for user to select "door" - implement doors as levels 
- Put interface in a while loop
- Create modules that define each realm/level
- Define riddles to access "realms" (what happens if right or wrong)
- Create different feautures within each realm upon selecting the door (entering realm/it's background screen, finding goose via click events, exit upon finding goose, back to main menu to select new door)
- Implement method for scoring
- Load images
- Implement win screen
- Load images
- Organize code with modules and functions


After today's class session, my plan is more clear and I have more direction. I'm excited to devote more time to developing my ideas and bringing my vision to fruition.
