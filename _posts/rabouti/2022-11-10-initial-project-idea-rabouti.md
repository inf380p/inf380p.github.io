## What's Exciting?
For the final project, I am definitely committed to the Turtle-based game option. I’m excited to create a program that strengthens my artistic abilities and allows me to express myself artistically/creatively with Python (while simultaneously exemplifying my fluency in Python). Additionally, I am excited by the creative freedom permitted. I see this project as a creative outlet and  a unique opportunity to elevate myself as an artist in a realm that is new to me (and one I would like to become a fixture in). Moreover, I’m excited to see how my current/budding vision evolves and to bring my final vision to fruition. 

## My Game
At present, I need to decide what details, goals, and features my game will entail and how to make a unique game that satisfies all of the project guidelines (i.e., effectively using dictionaries, external files, etc.). Currently, I want to make a hangman game that uses the images of Lisa Vanderpump (as the hangman ) and you have to guess  (via key events) which letters are in the quote. There will be levels where the quote is longer (I.e., more difficult to guess). 

###### Initial Steps 
-Design/set up display screen - allow user to interact to play game (with click event) - select which Lisa level you want to play by clicking her head (each head enters different level)
-Design background/screen of first level (add/load images) and ensure user can effectively/intentionally interact with/play the first level 
-Write function that can be utilized in each level that allows for increased difficulty / varying quotes 
-Adjust as necessary
