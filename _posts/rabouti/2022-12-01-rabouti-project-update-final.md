I’ve been doing a lot of research and watched numerous tutorials in order to bring my vision to fruition, but I have concluded that my concept is not feasible. Additionally, I was not happy of the concept of my game, so I have decided to take my game in a different direction. It’s been very difficult for me to stick with a plan because I keep scrapping each concept/starting over. 

I think my approach to this entire project has been overly ambitious, and I have placed an extensive amount of pressure on myself. Instead of putting too much expectation on a specific outcome, I am going to reevaluate and break down the code in a way that is more digestible for me and isn’t as overwhelming. 

My old concept:
Answer riddles to access treasure map (logic + luck based game)

My new concept:
Maze game + TBD. I want to add more detail and complexity as I add to my current program and work within the project guidelines. 

Through my extensive research, I realized to satisfy all of the requirements (using files, dictionaries, Turtle classes, using images) a maze game would be the most practical approach and provides the most creative flexibility.  

Considerable roadblocks ahead include:
- Incorporating external files
    - At present, I want to use an external file for the varying levels. 

To do: 
- Display Screen and Menu
- Implement levels and scoring
- Define functions
- Load images
- Win condition
- Add complexity to each level

Below is my new progress including a turtle Player class and click events:
