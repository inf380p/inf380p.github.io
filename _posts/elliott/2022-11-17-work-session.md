# Announcements


* The Classhack exercise is **Extra Credit**. I made this change last week, but it didn't get pushed.
* Optional **Regex** reading added, if you think that you'd like to use this content in your final
* Materials list order is reversed, with higher contrast. This should save you some scrolling
* **First Thing:** Please complete the [Final Project Type](https://forms.gle/mHdQGDCfNAXQRHJ57) form so that I can make final groups during a break.

# Overview of Class

Today our goals are:

* Review end-of semester items
* Pair up
* Merge Interface Draft 
* Github Cleanup
* Project Discussion


# End of Semester Items

* **Reminder:** Please complete the [Final Project Type](https://forms.gle/mHdQGDCfNAXQRHJ57) form so that I can make final groups during a break.

Before the final class, you'll need to have opened PRs with:

* Your Cultural Immersion (Meetup) Reflection
* Any optional revisions
* Any optional homework revisions posts

You'll turn in **all** of your github work via submitting a form with links to your posts and PRs. This will help you get credit for your post and any revisions you completed along the way. It's also a great exercise for you, since you'll need to review your work as you do it.
**If you want to get started collecting these links early, you can optionally do so in a separate document**. Submit the form only once, during class or afterwards, before midnight.

Questions?

# Groups & Discussion

Quick intermission while I make groups from the form responses.

# Pair up and merge up!

With your new partner, pair up and Merge your interface draft.

Then, complete the initial github cleanup activity, which teaches you how to make a **Github Issue**. Issues are ways of keeping track of things like ideas, problems, or decisions that need to be made about software.

# Project discussion.

Discuss your project with your partner and/or group. Present your interface draft.

You'll submit a **revised plan** (see assignment). The plan part is a list of steps you have and plan to take towards your final. You don't need to revise your code or reflection.

The revision part of this is to reflect anything you learned during your discussion, and ensure you're on track for the update post due the last day, and the final itself.
