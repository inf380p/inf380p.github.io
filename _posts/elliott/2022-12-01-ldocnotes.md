Thanks for a great semester!

# Announcements

* Class modality changed to **Remote** today because of unavoidable conflicts
* Code talk requirement removed from final
* Course evaluations influence how I'll evolve this course
* Logistics questions?

# Github Cleanup Help

After getting into groups, I'll stay in the main room to help with anything tricky.

Once you and your partner feel your github PRs etc are cleaned up, *including PRs due today*, move on to merging and discussing your final updates.

After that's done, use the rest of class time to work on your final.

# Keep coding!
