# Python 3

We'll be using Python 3 in Trinket for all text-based work.  Remember your `print()` functions.

`sep=" "` lets you specify what the seperator between arguments is.  It defaults to a space.

`end='\n'` lets you specify what to do at the end of the print functin.  It defaults to a newline.

You can make anonymous Python 3 trinkets on Trinket for free.  If you want the convenience of saving your
Python 3 trinkets to your account, you should use code `INF380P` to get our premium plan for free for the semester.

# Part I: Files & Lists Preview

There are a few core actions you should be able to perform on files:

* Open them (Dr. Chuck)
* Search/extract information from them (Dr. Chuck)
* Build a data structure from them (not really Dr. Chuck)
* Explore your data (not really Dr. Chuck)
* Print a table from your data (not Dr. Chuck)

We'll review all of these today, using a preview of your homework:
