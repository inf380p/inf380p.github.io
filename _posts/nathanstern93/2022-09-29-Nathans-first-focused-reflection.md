So far, the biggest issue I've had with this class is having the creativity to come up with a point that I want to get to. When I learned coding in the past, my professor would give us a problem and tell us to get from point a from point b without telling us how to do so. That is the problem solving that I am used to, and good at. So far, I think I understand all the technical concepts enough to keep moving forward, but struggle with creativity. One way that I dealt with this was just picking a subject or thing that is familiar and building code around that thing. For this code, I chose the University of Texas:
  
```python
if background_color == "red":
  print("Great, we love clifford")
  
elif background_color == "orange":
    print("Go horns!")
    
else:
  print("that's cool too")
```
  
And here is the full program:
