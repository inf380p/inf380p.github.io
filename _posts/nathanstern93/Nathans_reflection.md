So far in this course, I've simultaneously learned a lot, while being confused at other times.I feel very comfortable with grasping the concepts and coding we have learned so far. The logical and function practices on runestone are very fun, and I've found myself going back and repeating them. I think that this may be because I already learned some advanced R and did some difficult data analysis and cleaning. However, when I learned R, I primarily did it by drawing a line from point a to b. So a professor would say: here is some code, you need this result, figure out a way to get there. I've struggled with trinket and turtle because it feels so free-form, and I'm not the most creative person in the world. However, I know that pushing through these walls will only benefit me in the future.

Here's a program I worked on:
