# Turtle Program

I plan to create a program with two simple games. I will have a main menu at the beginning that allows they user to pick a game. The choice will launch the selected game. A 3rd menu option will be for exiting the program gracefully. 

## Game 1

- level 1 turtles that are (color 1) dots that move using random coordinates, User must click the (color 2) dot (only one)
- level 2 can speed up
- level 3 dots get smaller in size

## Game 2

- level 1 rotate through letters, user hits a key when a particular letter appears
- level 2 speed up
- level 3 letters in 2 locations

_I will have to figure out how I will incorporate the images later, maybe on the winner/game over screen?_

## Milestones

As far as Milestones, I will work in this order getting started:
- main menu
- Game 1 level 1
- Game 2 level 1
