title: Nikhil's Final Project Proposal
---

For my final project, I plan to create a data analysis program for historical Formula 1 datasets and make it possible for the user to navigate and be able to access several features to explore the data. Working on large and complex datasets is quite fascinating and the level of analysis possible for Formula 1 data presents a lot of opportunities. I've always wanted to create a user friendly program to oepnly explore such data and I feel the python skills I've aquired from this class will be really helpful in doing so.

I really liked working in turtle and the chessboard and hot-cold game I created were really fun. That being said, the tangible and objective goals that this data analysis gives makes it a more appealing option for me. This will help me set clear goals for the future and help me determine the progress of the project more accurately. I can also make several visualization based targets like graphs for the analysis that I carry forward. I plan to keep these targets as something good to have but not necessary to make the initial version of the application.

I plan to aquire both clean and messy datasets from reputed sources like Kaggle and then start the process of ingenstion, cleaning and analysis.
The vast variety and quality of F1 data available makes this a neat challenge and I hope to even surprise myself with the final product.
