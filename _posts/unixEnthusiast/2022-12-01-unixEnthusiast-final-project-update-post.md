### Progress so far
Followiing is a list of updates I've made to the project since the interface update. My project is focused on the reading of a set of F1 related CSV data files and then explore the data and make some interesting analysis on it.
|Milestone|Status  |
|--|--|
|Create aninterface and actionable menu to choose from|Done|
|Identify the data to be used for the analysis and extract the data|Done|
|Identify the files and data to be needed and clean the data to be used for the analysis|Done|
|Read the data into the trinket program|Done|
|Create the initial function for reading the data into the program|Done|
|Identify the next set of functions and analysis to do on the data|Started|
|Implement the next set of functions for the analysis|To Do|
|Test and Verify the program and check edge cases|To Do|

### Are there any roadblocks ahead? Is there anything your group can do to help out?
An issue I'm facing is the design of the data set. Although the data is quite comprehensive, it is distributed in a database kind of manner and requires joins to make sense of the results. Currently the results dataset data does not make much sense qithout the context of supporting files like drivers.csv and circuits.csv etc. I need to look into data processing modules like pandas which might help me in this regard.

###  Are your milestones ambitious enough? Make sure to include some stretch goals.
I feel the inital project pitch isn't ambitious in itself but when you look into the implementation with respect to the data being processed, it becomes quite a challenge and will be interesting to come up with solutions for the same. For stretch goals, I would say if I am able to do some inital analysis, I would love to include some graphical and visual analysis into the program to enhance its usability. This might be a good endgoal for the project.

###  Are your milestones too ambitious? Make sure to break down the unglamorous parts of coding into chunks that reflect the actual work to be done.
I feel the milestones from a high level are achievable especially when broken down into smaller blocks of sub-tasks. When taking into account the stretch goals of making the visual analysis, it makes it quite grand and will take some effort to get there.

###  Are you able to keep to your plan? Looking back at what youâ€™ve actually done, is the difference accountable to bad planning (i.e. not anticipating what needed to be done), bad execution (not doing it), or something else?
I feel I have been able to keep up to the plan and achieved the important milestones of reading and entering the data into the program. It will be interesting to optimise the read and join it with other data sets to make more sense of the data so those will be the next steps. Keeping the stretch goals in mind, I might have to incorporate some better planning but overall I am hapopy with the timelines and progress of the project.
