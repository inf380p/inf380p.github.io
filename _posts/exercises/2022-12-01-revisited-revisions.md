If you would like to revisit a reflection you completed early in the class, you can **Revisit** it.

To do this:

* Find the post you'd like to revisit
* **Append** (at the bottom, without removing the prior reflection) a Section with a `# Reflection Revisited` heading, and the date you're revisiting.
* In your revisited reflection, include a new perspective on the topic of the original assignment and a meta-reflection about how your process of reflecting has evolved.
 
I will assess your revisited content as part of your grade for the assignment, so in your revision include anything you wish you had the first time around. **There's nothing special to turn in, since the overall form on posts asks for any PRs modifying your posts.** Just include revision PRs alongside any others; the live post on the webiste will contain your revisions once they're all merged.

If you're satisfied with your original effort, no need to do this! It's a resource for those that have come to understand the level of effort I'm looking for in this class a little later on.
