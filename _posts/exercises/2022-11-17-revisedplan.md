Group & Pair up.  Read the below silently. Review & merge each other's pull requests.

Once this is done, present and discuss your idea & plan with your group. Then work on your
own to **Revise** your existing plan, **below** the plan you did for homework (i.e. in the
same post, not a new one).  

Ideally you'll be done with this before the end of class.
Have your partner review and merge your revised plan.

When you complete your progress report, start with your old plan, show a revised version (if any)
and describe your progress.

Refer to the Final Guides as needed.
