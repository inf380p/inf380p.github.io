Discuss your project idea and workplan with your group.

Some questions you may want to consider:

* Are there any roadblocks ahead?  Is there anything your group can do to help out?
* Are your milestones ambitious enough?  Make sure to include some stretch goals.
* Are your milestones too ambitious?  Make sure to break down the unglamorous parts of coding
into chunks that reflect the actual work to be done.
* Are you able to keep to your plan?  Looking back at what you've actually done, is the difference
accountable to bad planning (i.e. not anticipating what needed to be done), bad execution (not doing it), or
something else?

Explicitly state what you're working on next and what you intend to accomplish before next class. 

**Submit a pull request** with your current code, updated milestones, and a brief summary of the most relevant parts of your discussion
