Submit one Github pull request with a writeup of your off-campus cultural immersion meetup experience.

Cover questions like these:
* How did it go?
* What did you learn?
* Would you find value in this kind of event after class?
* How was the experience different from your expectations?
* Could you see yourself becomming a member of a professional community like this in the future?

The reflection should be several paragraphs long and show evidence that you've thought about the experience in relation to your learning.
