After *making a duplicate* of your original code from last week, begin to write a reflection. Revise the code as you go, based upon the reflection, classroom discussion, and your evolving understanfing of Python.

Make sure that you work over multiple sessions, and leave time to [make a good reflection great]({{ site.baseurl}}//how-to/reading/good-reflection.html).


Specific requirements:

* Submitted via a well-formed post and pull request (see How Tos for a review)
* A reflection describing your process, with at least two Markdown code blocks to illustrate specific points, and in-line code highlighting throughout.
* Two embedded trinkets, with your code as of the first deadline and your final code
* Your final code should identify and fix as many of the TODOs in the comments as you can.

In addition to these requirements, you will be evaluated on how well your code and reflection together show you encountering and describing problems or confusions, utlizing problem solving strategies, describing and refining your insights, and effectively writing about code. *Everything you did, though, and felt is potentially relevant*. I want you to _reflect_ upon how what you did, thought, and felt helped or hindered your learning process, and identify the light bulbs (insights) that went on for you, and the quesitons you still have.
