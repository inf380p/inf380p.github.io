If you'd like to get started on this assignment beforehand, do so in an external document, since the form itself should be submitted only once to avoid confusion.
If you encounter things you want to change about your posts in this process, complete them before you submit the form, so that you can include links to those PRs.

**During the final class**, or that night, complete [this form](https://forms.gle/qpSdCs5qf8rzMsjZ6), which asks for links to your Github work and a portfolio of your most positive interactions with classmates on Github.
