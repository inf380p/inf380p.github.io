Going back over items in this course that puzzled you can be a really powerful way to cement your learning.

You may submit: 
* up to 3 trinkets based off of difficult Runestone problems that you didn't get the first time around, along with a reflection on what wasn't clear for you intially and what changed for you. This is intended to encourage you to revisit areas of our course material that weren't as clear to you.

The important components of this are:

* correct/revised code
* a substantial reflection about what you've learned since originally completing the exercise

**Please include "Extra Credit" in the title of the PR.
