If you would like to revisit a reflection you completed early in the class, you can **Revisit** it.

To do this:

* Find the post you'd like to revisit
* **Append** (at the bottom, without removing the prior reflection) a Section with a `# Reflection Revisited` heading, and the date you're revisiting.
* In your revisited reflection, include a new perspective on the topic of the original assignment and a meta-reflection about how your process of reflecting has evolved.
 
I will assess your revisited content as part of your grade for the assignment, so include anything you wish you had the first time around.

If you're satisfied with your original effort, no need to do this! It's a resource for those that have come to understand the level of effort I'm looking for in this class a little later on.
