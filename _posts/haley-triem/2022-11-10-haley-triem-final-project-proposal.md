# Here are my thoughts for the final project ...

I had trouble initially deciding what to do, because, (not to be dramatic), it feels like my heart was telling me to do a Turtle-based project but my brain was telling me to do data processing.  Instinctually, a Turtle-based project seems more interesting, however since I am considering trying out data processing as a field, it makes more sense to do data processing.

When it comes down to it, however, I think I should stick to a Turtle-based project, because the excitement and creativity of building a game will help motivate me through the final stretch of the semester. My two vague ideas behind a Turtle game are a) doing a text-based game and b) doing a game with boss behaviors that are based on different `classes`. I enjoyed what we did in class today, where we defined different `classes` of turtles, and it reminded me of how the pacman ghosts have different “personalities.”

It might be interesting to see if I can create a word-based game that has different boss behavior. But how could I make it challenging for people to beat? Can typing speed be accounted for? How do I course-correct for mistypes / spelling (an issue I had with  my 8-ball user input questions)? Maybe it should be a multiple choice type situation? Variable bosses and challenges would be much more interesting in general to me.

And although I want to use this project to hone in on my skills learned in this class, I am already growing ambitious over the possibilities: what could I do with easter eggs? Are there ways to embed music? If I have the time, what kind of graphics could I develop? Maybe I can involve data-processing methods in my game, to help me learn skills from both options? I truly believe that this excitement and curiosity will fuel me through my final project, and that I need to harness it to drive the end of the semester.

I haven't had the chance to start the project yet, but here are my plans for the next few weeks:

- week 1: draft out code and set up a basic interface; block out a story if it's text-based
- week 2: continue writing code, making sure to refactor, test, and clean throughout; play with random module and classes of bosses
- week 3: clean up code and run final tests
- week 4: add visuals, easter eggs, etc.
