### Project Working On

I will do a data analysis project. Currently, I am playing an NBA Fantasy game, and I want to use Python to do data analysis so that it can help me to make some decisions.

### What Excites Me?
I hope this program can actually help me to play the fantasy game. Maybe I can use the program to find sleeper players.

### What do I need to help decide?
I am wondering if I can do some visualization. If I can visualize the data, I believe it can help me understand the data well. However, it is really a challenge...

### Milestones
I think the first stuff is to find the data. I believe there should be some websites that provide data in CSV format, such as ESPN. If I can find the CSV file, I don't need to crawl the data by myself. After I find the data, I think I will try to parse the data. Once I get the processed data, I can try to implement some data analysis.
