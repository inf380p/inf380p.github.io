title: "Initial Thoughts for Project"

I think the end result of programming being a aesthetically pleasing data visualization is what excites me. I want to code mainly because I want to achieve the end result of data visualization, although I also find some joy in the iterative process of coding itself. 

The information about what I will need to do for this project would help me decide, although to be honest I am pretty solidly in the data processing camp already. 

I will pick the Data Processing project type. 

I will aim to add value and clean up the Scottish Witchcraft Trials dataset that I have worked with previously.
