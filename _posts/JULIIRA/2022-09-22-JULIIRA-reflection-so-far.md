What’s a lightbulb that has gone on for you? Give an example.

Currently, creating usable variables and user input prompts and using operators and operands are lightbulb moments for me. 
An example of creating usable variables (This is what I input for the textbook exercise):

  ```
var1='twinkle'
var2='twinkle'
var3='little'
var4='star'
print(var1, var2, var3, var4, ".")
```
  
An example of user input prompts I had created so far: 
name = input('what is your name?')
print(name)

Another example of me learning how to use operators is this exercise from our textbook (chapter 2.17)

```
apples = 4
pears = 3
a=0.4
p=0.65
totalCost =(4*a)+(3*p)
print(totalCost) 
```

Describe some confusion you’ve experienced. Did it help you learn?

Some confusion I'm still struggling to understand is using the int() function and creating codes that include converting metrics (temperature and measurements). 
I think I still have to go over this part again as I am still confused about these types of codes. Also, the recent exercise (functional turtles) is very confusing and frustrating
to understand. I think I will have to go over this part more as I am having trouble trying to execute some of the codes. 

What’s still fuzzy for you? What will you do to make sure you can resolve your fuzziness?

Creating codes that include converting metrics and making conditional codes are difficult for me. I think because I'm not inputting the conditional statements correctly because I keep 
getting syntax error. Also, it doesn't help that there are so many lines that it can get a bit overwhelming and difficult to understand how a code was executed. 
I will most likely go over the chapters to help me figure out how to do both. However, I am a visual and hands-on learner so I will most likely watch youtube videos to understand it better. 

What problem solving strategies have been working for you? Give an example.

Whenever I need to debug my codes, I usually go through the 4 R's, but I mostly use the reading, running and retreating strategies. If I get too frustrated,
I will retreat because I am not productive when I am frustrated  so I take a moment to collect myself before starting again, which always helps. Also, going over my notes and
readings help me figure out what I'm doing wrong and helps me figure out how to debug a code. Most of the time though, I keep retyping or readjusting the lines or retreating to calm down.
However, once I debug a code, it is one of the best feelings ever and it motivates me to keep learning and to continue coding.  

Example:

During class, we were going over the conditional statements (adjective, noun, and number). I kept messing up so I would reread my codes and sometimes I would fig
ure out the issue 
but when reading doesn't work, I keep inputting, redadjusting and running the code until I realize what the issue is.

Include at least 2 code examples from code you’ve written for this class.
