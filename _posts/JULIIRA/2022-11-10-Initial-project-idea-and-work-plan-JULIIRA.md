title: "Initial project idea and plan"

I am definitely choosing to do turtle for my project because I am more familiar and comfortable with it.
I am also a visual learner so it's easier for me to spot out my mistakes if I can see it,  which is why I don't think doing a data processing project is for me. 
In addition, we spent most of the semester doing turtle so it'll be easier for me to recall 
the stuff we learn and implement them into the project. Also, turtle would give me more creative freedom so that's what excites me.
Another aspect that excites me about doing a turtle project is that I get to see visually what my code has done and I am looking forward 
to seeing the results of my hard work come to life. 

So far my ideas and plan for this project is inspired by the retro game frogger except in this case, the character of the game
will be a snapping turtle and its main goal is to eat all the apples on the road while dodging moving traffic. 

My project timeline (most likely to change as I go forward in this project so it is not a set timeline): 

This weekend: sketch out what I want the game to look like and figure out possible codes that I'll be using
while keeping in mind the required codes needed for this final. So far, my main character of the game will be a turtle, the apples will be circles,
moving traffic will be squares. I am thinking of giving the turtle three lives so there will be three turtle icons on the bottom, and each time
the turtle gets hit, a turtle will hide. I'm thinking of adding a time limit to the game but I am unsure if I should as I don't know how to do that yet. Maybe if time
permits I will do add a time limit to the game just to make things more interesting. My guess is that I would need to import time into the code and use the code break 
to signal that time is up.

First week: creating the shapes and setting them in position, doing debugging in the process (changing shapes using shape(), might use position or goto code).
Using speed() to set the turtle's and car's speed. I will also make their speed increase as the player moves on to the next level. During this phase, I will also 
figure out how to include a guide to help players throughout the game.

Second week: experimenting with conditionals and functions to see if they'll help me change to different levels and to set up the levels, 
debugging. Conditionals can be used to help me change screens (for example: when the turtle meets the condition, the code will break and move on to next 
level but I don't know if I can do it). 

Third week: creating new levels using conditionals and functions, this might require animations.py or interfaces for transiting to next level)

Fourth week: cleaning up the program, debugging everything, trying to make it as functional as possible.

If I have any difficulty during this project, I will use the following guides to refresh my memory: past lectures, past codes and python docs.
