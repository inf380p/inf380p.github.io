# Since Last Class...
I’ve made a ton of progress. This project is the only thing I attempted to work on over Thanksgiving break. I was really stressed out for about a day and a half, I made very little progress during that time. I was mostly trying to shift from one module to multi-module and attempting to add endings to my games. It’s come to my attention that creating two games was a silly choice and I’m not sure why I felt like that was a good idea. I was pleased to receive a suggestion from my brother-in-law who is familiar with a different computer language. He said to meet my imported file requirement by providing the text for the help feature, two birds one stone.  

Since my game 1 (dot game) is modeled after a wack-a-mole concept, I would have loved to change the red dot in game 1 to a little mole image. Unfortunately, I struggled to resize the image and use it as the turtle shape. I referenced the how-to guides but it did not really help for my particular situation. Instead, I opted to change the game backgrounds from solid colors, to gradients through images. I also added an image in the dot game ending.  

To alleviate meeting all the requirements for both games, I have decided to meet all the requirements for the program as a whole but not necessarily for both games individually.  


### I achieved everything from my milestone list in my last post which included:
- randomize "it" movement in game 1
- focus on adding levels
- incorporate an image(s)
- create user key response in game 2
- migrate everything into a multi-module program  

## This is where I currently am:

### I have completed most of the requirements already, which is a relief:
- ✅  At least one external data file. For Turtle, this can be game settings, character data, or etc. For the data tool, this should be your data.
- ✅   Dictionaries
- ✅   Custom modules 
- ✅   Definite (for) loop
- ✅   Custom functions
- ✅   A Python 3 or Pygame (Python 3 + GUI) Trinket. For Turtle projects only, a Python trinket with the #!/bin/python3 shebang enabled is acceptable.
- ✅  Have a graphical user interface, responding to key and click events
- ✅  Display information about the program’s state such as score or level
- ✅  Have at least 3 levels, increasing in difficulty
- ✅  Extend a custom Turtle Class
- ✅  Have a ‘win’ screen
- ✅  Use one or more custom images
- ✅  Have a constantly available help dialog. This can take many forms but should allow the user to learn what they can do in the program at any time.
- Have an iterative interface. That is, the user should be able to perform any number of supported actions (such as playing the game over and over)  


I will spend the last few days making sure the navigation of my program is smooth, meaning I will work on the iterative interface requirement. Additionally, I will spend some time improving the differences in my level changes, cleaning up my code, making sure it's well commented, and resolving any errors.
